# AWS SAA-C03 Study Guide — Companion Notes

Deeper-dive notes that go **beyond** the Anki deck. The deck is for fast recall
of *what a service is* and *when to pick it*; this guide is for the "I need to
actually understand this" moments — concepts, trade-offs, and how a topic shows
up in real architecture decisions.

## How to use this guide

- Each topic follows the same template (see below) so it stays scannable.
- Two scenario types accompany each topic: a **greenfield design** decision and
  a **lift-and-shift / migration** decision, since the exam frames questions
  both ways.
- Add new topics under [Topics](#topics) and link them in the table of contents.

### Topic template

```markdown
### <Topic name>

**Concept** — plain-language explanation.
**Why it matters** — the practical payoff.
**Exam angle** — the distinctions/"don't confuse with" the exam tests.

**Scenario — design:** <new-build situation and the right call>
**Scenario — lift & shift:** <migration situation and the right call>

**Resources:** links.

### Anycast IPs & AWS Global Accelerator

**Concept** — *Anycast* is an addressing method where the **same IP address is
advertised from many locations at once**, and internet routing (BGP) delivers
each user to the *nearest* one. Contrast with **unicast** (the normal case),
where one IP maps to one server in one place: a user in Tokyo hitting a unicast
IP in Virginia sends packets all the way to Virginia. With anycast, that same IP
is announced from Tokyo, Frankfurt, and Virginia simultaneously, and each user's
traffic enters at whichever site is closest in network terms — same destination
IP, different physical endpoint.

**Why it matters**

- **Lower latency** — traffic enters the provider's backbone at the nearest
  point of presence instead of crossing the public internet to a distant region.
- **Availability & failover** — if one location goes down, BGP simply routes to
  the next-nearest one.
- **DDoS resilience** — an attack is spread across many sites rather than
  concentrated on a single server.
- **Stable entry point** — you get a fixed IP that "follows" the user
  geographically.

**AWS Global Accelerator** is AWS's anycast offering: it gives you **two static
anycast IP addresses** that act as a fixed front door. Users connect to the
nearest AWS edge location via those IPs, then traffic rides the **AWS backbone**
to your application in whichever Region is healthiest — with fast, sub-minute
failover.

**Exam angle — don't confuse with:**

- **vs CloudFront** — CloudFront *caches* HTTP/HTTPS content at the edge. Global
  Accelerator does **not** cache; it just gets any **TCP/UDP** traffic onto the
  AWS network fast and fails over quickly. Reach for GA for non-HTTP protocols,
  gaming, IoT, VoIP, or when you need static IPs; reach for CloudFront for
  cacheable web content.
- **vs Route 53 latency/geo routing** — Route 53 steers users by handing back
  *different IPs* in DNS responses (subject to DNS caching/TTL). GA steers users
  with a *single shared anycast IP*, so failover isn't gated on DNS propagation.
- **vs Standard unicast + DNS** — DNS-based steering gives different users
  different addresses; anycast achieves steering with one address.

**Scenario — design:** You're building a real-time multiplayer game backend on
NLBs in `us-east-1` and `ap-northeast-1`. Players worldwide need the lowest
possible latency over UDP and a single stable endpoint to hard-code in the
client. → **Global Accelerator**: two static anycast IPs, edge ingress onto the
AWS backbone, automatic routing to the nearest healthy Region. CloudFront
wouldn't fit (non-cacheable UDP), and Route 53 alone leaves you exposed to DNS
TTL during failover.

**Scenario — lift & shift:** You migrate a legacy on-prem application whose
clients have a firewall allowlist of **specific IP addresses** baked in and
can't be easily changed. You still want multi-Region resilience after the move.
→ **Global Accelerator** gives you two fixed anycast IPs to put on the allowlist
once, while you remain free to change, scale, or fail over the backend Regions
behind them without ever touching the client config.
